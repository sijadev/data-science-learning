# ðŸ”€ Conditional Statements

## if Statement

The if statement allows code to be executed only under certain conditions.

```python
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
```

## if-elif-else Chain

For multiple conditions we use elif (else if):

```python
if grade >= 90:
    rating = "Excellent"
elif grade >= 80:
    rating = "Very good"
elif grade >= 70:
    rating = "Good"
else:
    rating = "Needs improvement"
```
